---
## Project Summary

The project "Optimizing Database Design for Meraki Delivery Company" aims to enhance operational efficiency and streamline delivery processes by redefining the company's database architecture. Through a meticulous process of Entity-Relationship Diagram (EER) development and Logical Transformation implementation, the project addresses the unique requirements of Meraki Delivery Company.

The project unfolds in several key stages:

**1. Meraki Database Requirement Analysis:** This phase delves into the company's background and elucidates the necessity of developing an EER diagram and integrating Logical Transformation. By aligning the database structure with operational goals, the project lays the foundation for improved efficiency.

**2. EER Diagram + Logical Transformation:** A comprehensive resource encompasses the intricately designed EER diagram and the real-world application of Logical Transformation. This phase ensures that the database architecture is tailored to optimize Meraki Delivery Company's delivery processes, contributing to streamlined operations.

**3. Creating SQL Meraki Database:** Building upon the EER diagram and Logical Transformation, the project materializes into the creation of the SQL database for Meraki Delivery Company. This tangible outcome reflects the culmination of efforts to enhance data management and accessibility.

**4. Query to Find Insights from Meraki Database:** The project concludes with the formulation of an insightful SQL query. This query is designed to extract valuable insights from the optimized database, enabling Meraki Delivery Company to make informed business decisions.

By seamlessly integrating these components, the "Optimizing Database Design for Meraki Delivery Company" project equips the company with an enhanced database architecture. This, in turn, empowers Meraki Delivery Company to operate more efficiently, make data-driven decisions, and provide a streamlined and effective delivery service.
